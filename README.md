This is a custom UIView that can perform elastic animation on its background.

Accompanied is an example of using this ElasticView as the background in a UITextfield.

**Note**: This demonstration is mainly the output of following this inspiring tutorial, [How To Create an Elastic Animation with Swift](http://www.raywenderlich.com/100939/how-to-create-an-elastic-animation-with-swift). Though, the final solution provided by the original author has some glitches, and, in my opinion, is not complete. Therefore, I made this modified version which additionally accommodates size changes, fixes the animation and background color issues (mentioned in the tutorial post), updates to *Swift 2*. Full acknowledgement is given to the original author.
